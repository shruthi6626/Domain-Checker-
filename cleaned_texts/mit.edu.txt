Spotlight: Jul 8, 2025 Researchers have developed a robotic probe that autonomously measures the properties of key semiconductor materials much faster than previous methods. The work could help speed the discovery of better materials for solar panels and other electronics. Jul 8, 2025 Full story Share: Twitter Facebook Research and Education that Matter High-performance metals Foundation Alloy creates high-performance metals using a novel process that doesnât rely on melting raw materials. The MIT alumni behind the company say its alloys can be made twice as strong as traditional metals with 10 times faster product development. Real-world impact Sabrina Corsetti builds photonic devices that manipulate light to enable the previously unimaginable, like pocket-sized 3D printers. The EECS PhD student says the ability to work on projects with real-world impact âis primarily what drew me to MIT.â Inexpensive disease diagnostics An electrode coated with DNA could yield disposable diagnostics adapted to detect cancer, influenza, or HIV. This approach could enable inexpensive tests to detect many diseases in the doctorâs office or even at home. Reshoring critical metals refining Nth Cycle is bringing critical metals refining back to America. Co-founded by DesirÃ©e Plata, the firm is producing nickel and cobalt from electronic waste in Ohio. She says it benefits from MITâs âentrepreneurial ecosystem and the âtough techâ ethos. A world without MIT In a world without MIT, radar wouldnât have been available to help win World War II. We might not have email, CT scans, time-release drugs, photolithography, or GPS. And weâd lose over 30,000 companies, employing millions of people. Can you imagine? Contributions to the nation âSince its founding, MIT has been key to helping American science and innovation lead the world. Discoveries that begin here generate jobs and power the economy â and what we create today builds a better tomorrow for all of us.
