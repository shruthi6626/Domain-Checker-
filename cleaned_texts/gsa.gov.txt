It transitions to a camera slowly zooming out to a frontal view of two women and one man standing side by side in front of a dry erase board. The woman in the middle uses a white marker to circle the word “Plane” on the board. Then it transitions to a side view of a walkway with handrails and glass panes reveals the blurry image of ships in the background. A man in business attire carries his luggage down the walkway, then continues off frame. It transitions again to two men and one woman, all wearing business attire, sitting at a table engaged in a conversation. The man on the left nods in approval as the man on the right gestures in explanation. The last transition shows a timelapse of a sunset slightly obscured by low-flying clouds, creating a calm glow over an array of solar panels.

                unless lodging is not available at the work activity, then the agency may authorize the rate where
                lodging is obtained. Unless otherwise specified, the per diem locality is defined as "all locations within, or entirely
                  surrounded by, the corporate limits of the key city, including independent entities located within
                  those boundaries." Per diem localities with county definitions shall include "all locations within, or entirely
                  surrounded by, the corporate limits of the key city as well as the boundaries of the listed counties,
                  including independent entities located within the boundaries of the key city and the listed counties
                  (unless otherwise listed separately)." When a military installation or Government - related facility(whether or not specifically named) is
                located partially within more than one city or county boundary, the applicable per diem rate for the
                entire installation or facility is the higher of the rates which apply to the cities and / or counties,
