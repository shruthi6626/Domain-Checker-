She helped launch the inaugural season for women's soccer at Caltech in 2017 and says the sport and the team teach lessons that help her in the classroom and on the field. The chemical engineering major is inspired by the researchers and professors on campus, and she is committed to building a legacy for other young women at Caltech. read more Alumnus (BS '20) David Ignacio Fager For as long as he can remember, David Ignacio Fager has adored mathematics. In high school, he lived for Mu Alpha Theta competitions and skipped ahead in math textbooks the way impatient readers sometimes peek at the last page of a mystery novel. Then came freshman year of college, and Caltech’s social science core introduced him to a new love: economics.
