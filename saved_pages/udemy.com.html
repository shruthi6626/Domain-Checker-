The program is designed to be accessible to learners of all backgrounds, regardless of previous experience."},{"question":"How are courses selected for career accelerators?","answer":"Courses are carefully curated by Udemy’s content experts using data-driven insights from our global learner base of over 62 million. We prioritize top-rated, fresh, and relevant courses for professional learners."},{"question":"What is a full-stack web developer?","answer":"A full-stack web developer is someone who is skilled in both front-end and back-end development. They build both the front-end (client-side) and work with databases, servers, and frameworks for the back-end (server-side). Full-stack developers can build and manage entire web applications from start to finish."},{"question":"How long does it take to become a full-stack developer?","answer":"Becoming a full-stack developer typically takes 3 months to 1 year, depending on the amount of time you can dedicate to learning. For example, if you can dedicate 30-40 hours a week it can take 3-4 months to become a full stack developer , whereas if you can spend 10-15 hours a week it could take up to one year."},{"question":"Is a Full-Stack Developer the same as a Web Developer?","answer":"Web developers specialize in either front-end (user interface) or back-end (server-side) development, while full-stack developers work on both. Full-stack developers handle the entire web application, from design to database management. So, a full-stack developer is a type of web developer, but not all web developers are full-stack."},{"question":"Can I become a full stack developer with no experience?","answer":"Yes, you can become a full-stack developer without experience. Employers often prioritize job applicants who can demonstrate the skills needed to be successful.
